        Our ultimate goal is to create pan American symphonies , musicals , and
        operas of unprecedented scale and quality. As the goal presupposes a
        deep familiarity with music , musicians , and music lovers , we will
        play almost anything almost any where.{" "}

        Both more and less than a band: we feature a revolving group of artists,
        and can be as big or small or the situation requires. Check our artistâ€™s
        page for past and current collaborators.
